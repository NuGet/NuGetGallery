## Children's Privacy
Outercurve is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Outercurve does not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13, and Outercurve does not target the Web site to children.

## Links to Non-Outercurve Web Sites
The NuGet Gallery Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites for the convenience of our users. If you access those links, you will leave the NuGet Gallery Web site. Outercurve does not control these third-party Web sites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Statement. For example, other Web sites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from that described in this document. Therefore, you should use other Web sites with caution, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any Web site before submitting personal information.

## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

### Non-Personal Information
Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. Outercurve may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use the NuGet Gallery Web site.

### Aggregate Information
Outercurve may gather aggregate information, which refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and which cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the Web sites you visited just before and just after the Web site), the pages viewed, time spent at the Web site, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.

### Log Files
Every time you request or download a file from the Web site, Outercurve may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. Outercurve may use this information to analyze trends, administer the Web site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes.

### Cookies
The Web site may use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a Web site's computer stores on your computer. The NuGet Gallery Web site can then read the cookies whenever you visit the Web site. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save an authentication token so that you don't have to enter your username and password each time you visit our site, to deliver content specific to your interests and to track the pages you've visited. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to customize your NuGet Gallery experience so that your visit to the Web site is as relevant and as valuable to you as possible.

Most browser software can be set up to deal with cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, certain functions and conveniences of the Web site may not work properly, and you may be unable to use those NuGet Gallery services that require registration in order to participate, or you will have to re-enter your username and password each time you visit the Web site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.

### Web Beacons
The NuGet Gallery Web site also may use Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of the Web site. The information collected by Web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Web site; how many people open our emails; and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of the Web site. Outercurve does not link non-personal information from Web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission.

### Personal Information
Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. Outercurve uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. On some NuGet Gallery Web pages, you may be able to view information about NuGet packages, download NuGet packages, provide feedback, submit information into registries, register for notifications, or upload NuGet packages. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, email address, user IDs, passwords, or other information.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Outercurve may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about the NuGet Gallery Web site usability, performance, and effectiveness. It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the Web site.

### Information Sharing
Outercurve does not sell, rent, or lease any individual's personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information. However, Outercurve reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which Outercurve may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of the Council's mission. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our Terms of Use or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, Outercurve may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders.

In keeping with our open process, Outercurve may maintain publicly accessible archives for Web site activities. For example, submitting the report abuse form may result in your description of the abuse becoming part of the publically accessible archives. In all such cases, we will ensure to the greatest degree possible, that personal information is protected.

Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of the Web site, such as NuGet package uploads, discussions, and social networking features, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these.

Given the international scope of Outercurve, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country's privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. If you are unsure whether this privacy statement is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("EU Privacy Directive"), individuals located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Statement and to its transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America.

If you do not want your personal information collected and used by Outercurve, please do not visit the NuGet Gallery Web site or download or upload NuGet packages.

### Security
Outercurve makes every effort to protect personal information by users of the Web site, including using firewalls and other security measures on its servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any Web site, including the NuGet Gallery. Much of the personal information is used in conjunction with participation-level services such as sharing and exchanging NuGet packages, so some types of personal information such as your name, company affiliation, and email address will be visible to other Outercurve participators and to the public. Outercurve assumes no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when you access the Web site and provide personal information.

### Opting Out
From time to time Outercurve may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.
