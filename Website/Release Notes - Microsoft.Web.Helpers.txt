Release Notes
-------------

In this new update to the ASP.NET Web Helpers Library, we have integrated the Twitter and Facebook helpers to just be included. 
These will continue to be updated in the future.

We have also fixed the URL change that Google recently made so the ReCaptcha helper will now work again (see 
http://groups.google.com/group/recaptcha-announce/browse_thread/thread/c1ff6844420c9e63).

Bing has removed their support for the underlying mechanism for the Bing.AdvancedSearchBox to work. Therefore, this method has been removed in this release.  
Bing has a replacement API and we will add this back in a future version.
