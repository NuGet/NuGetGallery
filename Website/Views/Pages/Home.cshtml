    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project 
    (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that no clutter is left.</p>

    <h3>Important Notice</h3>
    <p>You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery. Read the documentation for more details on 
    <a title="Creating and submitting a package" href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package">how to 
    create and publish a package</a>. If you don&rsquo;t plan on submitting a package, there&rsquo;s no need to register.</p>
