<p class="message">
    To edit the metadata for a package, please <a href="@Url.UploadPackage()">upload an updated version of the package</a>.
</p>
<p>
    NuGet currently does not allow updating package metadata on the website. This helps ensure 
    that the package itself (and the source used to build the package) remains the one true 
    source of package metadata.
</p>
<p>
    This does require that you increment the package version.
