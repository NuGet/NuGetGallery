# Using Azure Active Directory authentication

You can configure the NuGetGallery to use Azure Active Directory to manage your accounts.

## Create an Azure Active Directory application registration

1. On the portal, open the ["App registrations" blade](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade).
1. Select "New registration".
1. For "Supported account types", select "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)".

> âš  **NOTE**: This allows any Azure Active Directory or personal account to create an account and publish packages to your on-prem gallery. If you'd like to authenticate with a specific directory (the "Single tenant" option), you will need to make a code change later.

1. For "Redirect URI", select "Web" with the value `https://<Your domain>/users/account/authenticate/return`.
1. Press "Register" to create the application.

You will need to configure the Azure Active Directory application before it can be used by the NuGetGallery:

1. On the "Overview" pane, note down the "Application (client) ID".
1. Navigate to the "Authentication" pane. Under the "Implicit grant" section, enable "ID tokens" and press "Save".
1. Navigate to "Certificates & secrets" pane and create a new client secret. Note the value of your client secret.

## Configure the Gallery

Now that the Azure Active Directory application is ready, let's configure the NuGetGallery to use your new app:

1. Open the NuGetGallery solution using Visual Studio.
1. Modify the "Web.config" file in the NuGetGallery project.
1. Modify the `Auth.AzureActiveDirectoryV2.Enabled` setting to `true`.
1. Modify the `Auth.AzureActiveDirectoryV2.ClientId` setting to the application ID you copied earlier.
1. Modify the `Auth.AzureActiveDirectoryV2.ClientSecret` setting to the client secret you copied earlier.

If you selected the "Single tenant" option when you created your Azure Active Directory app registration, update [`AzureActiveDirectoryV2AuthenticatorConfiguration`](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/0659deed143f0b58868fa691ec22f46f1d57cba6/src/NuGetGallery.Services/Authentication/Providers/AzureActiveDirectoryV2/AzureActiveDirectoryV2AuthenticatorConfiguration.cs#L53) to set the authority tenant ID to your AAD Tenant ID:

```csharp
openIdOptions.Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, AzureActiveDirectoryV2Authenticator.Authority, "<Your AAD Tenant ID>");
```
