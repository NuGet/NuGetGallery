## Downtime April 2nd-3rd
We are very sorry for the downtime and service interruptions that occurred on April 2nd and April 3rd.  We know that there are countless developers around the world that rely on nuget.org being up and running all day every day, and weâ€™re sorry that we let you down. We are working to improve our reliability.

After completing a new deployment on April 3rd, we published a [blog post](http://blog.nuget.org/20140403/nuget-2.8.1-april-2nd-downtime.html) with details about what caused the downtime and what we've done to address it.

Thank you for your support,

[Jeff Handley](https://twitter.com/jeffhandley) and the entire [NuGet team](https://twitter.com/nuget)
