	<h3>NuGet Feed Locations</h3>
	
	<p>
		NuGet delivers packages to your project from a feed URL that provides interactions with the repository for your NuGet client.
		For NuGet.org, <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog#package-sources">configure your NuGet clients</a>
		to use one of the following repository URLs:
		
		<ul>
			<li>NuGet feed v3 (VS 2015 / NuGet v3.x): <code>https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json</code></li>
			<li>NuGet feed v2 (VS 2013 and earlier / NuGet 2.x): <code>https://www.nuget.org/api/v2</code></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

    <h3>About</h3>

	<p>When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that no clutter is left.</p>

	<p>To learn more about the NuGet Gallery project and see who has contributed, see the <a href="/policies/About">About the Gallery</a> page.</p>

	<h3>Important Notice</h3>

	<p>You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery. Read the documentation for more details on <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package" title="Creating and submitting a package">how to create and publish a package</a>.</p>
