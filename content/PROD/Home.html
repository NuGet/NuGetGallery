    <h3>About</h3>

<p>When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that no clutter is left.</p>

<p>To learn more about the NuGet Gallery project and see who has contributed, see the <a href="/policies/About">About the Gallery</a> page.</p>

<h3>Important Notice</h3>

<p>You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery. Read the documentation for more details on <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package" title="Creating and submitting a package">how to create and publish a package</a>.</p>
