## NuGet 2.6 Released
We are excited to announce that NuGet 2.6 has been released and it is included
in the box with Visual Studio 2013 Preview.  For Visual Studio 2010 and Visual
Studio 2012, **upgrade now** using the Visual Studio Extension Manager.

For details about what's in the release,
read the [release notes](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-2.6).

**NOTE**: When using Visual Studio 2010, if you encounter an error while upgrading
from an older version of NuGet you will need to uninstall the older version of NuGet first 
(Tip: Make sure to run Visual Studio as an admin) then install NuGet. We are sorry for any
inconvenience this might cause, more info can be found in the
