                     * Alternatively, we could handle the DB conflict exception that would occur in request 2, but this
                     * would result in an exception that can be avoided and require some ugly code that teases the
                     * unique constraint failure out of a SqlException.
                     * 
                     * Another alternative is always leaving the package in the validation container. This is not great
                     * since it doubles the amount of space we need to store packages. Also, it complicates the soft or
                     * hard package delete flow.
                     * 
                     * We can safely delete the validation package because we know it's ours. We know this because
                     * saving the validation package succeeded, meaning async validation already successfully moved the
                     * previous package (request 1's package) from the validation container to the package container
                     * and transitioned the package to Available status.
