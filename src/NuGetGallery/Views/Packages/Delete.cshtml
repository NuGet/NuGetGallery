    Unlisting a package hides the package from search results and all NuGet commands, but packages
    are still available for download. For example, they can still be downloaded as dependencies to
    other packages.

    <h2>Why can&#8217;t I delete my package?</h2>
    <p>
        Our policy is to only permanently delete NuGet packages that really need it, such as
        packages that contain passwords, malicious/harmful code, etc. This policy is very similar
        to the policies employed by other package managers such as
        <a href="http://help.rubygems.org/kb/gemcutter/removing-a-published-rubygem">Ruby Gems</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlisting the package will prevent users from finding it by searching the gallery and it will prevent the dependency resolver from discovering the package.
        However, the package will still be available for download through <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-restore">NuGet Package Restore</a> so that existing projects referencing the package don't become broken.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need the package permanently removed, click on the <a href="@Url.Action(actionName: "ReportAbuse", controllerName: "Packages", routeValues: new {id = Model.Id, version = Model.Version})" title="Contact Support">Contact Support</a> link and we'll take care
        of it for you. PLEASE ONLY DO THIS IF THERE IS AN URGENT PROBLEM WITH THE PACKAGE.
        (Passwords, malicious code, etc). Even if you remove it, it's prudent to immediately
        reset any passwords/sensitive data you accidentally pushed instead of waiting for us to delete
        the package.
