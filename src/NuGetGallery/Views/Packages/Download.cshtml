<h1 class="page-heading">How to download a package?</h1>
<p>
    The short answer is <em>don't</em>, at least not manually. NuGet provides a faster better way to incorporate a library into your project.
</p>

<p>
    Give it a try:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget" title="Installing NuGet"><strong>Install NuGet</strong></a> (it&#8217;s quick and easy)
    </li>
    <li>
        Then start using it to <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/managing-nuget-packages-using-the-dialog" title="Managing NuGet packages"><strong>find and acquire your favorite libraries</strong></a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why NuGet?</h2>
<p>
    Typically, when you download a zip file that contains an assembly, you have to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>&#8220;Unblock&#8221; the package to mark the downloaded package as safe</li>
    <li>Unzip the package contents (assemblies, images, css files, etc.) into a location in the solution</li>
    <li>Add an assembly reference to the project</li>
    <li>Update the web.config file with the correct settings (which you probably have to search for if they’re not included in the package somehow.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    NuGet does all this for you! For a brief overview of what NuGet is,
