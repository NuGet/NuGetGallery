            <h1>About NuGet</h1>
            <p>
                An essential tool for any modern development platform is a mechanism through which developers can create, share, and consume useful libraries and packages. For .NET, that mechanism is NuGet, which defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles. 
            </p>

            <h2>The NuGet Team</h2>
