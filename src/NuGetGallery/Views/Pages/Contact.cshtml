    <h3>Having problems using a specific package?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're having trouble installing a specific package, try contacting the owner of that package first. 
        You can reach them using the "Contact Owners" link on the package details page.
    </p>

    <h3>Is a package violating a license or otherwise abusive?</h3>
    <p>
        If you feel that a package is violating the license of software you own or is violating our terms of service,
        use the "Report Abuse" link on the package details page to report it directly to us.
    </p>

    <h3>Having issues working with NuGet.org?</h3>
    <p>
        Before reaching out to NuGet support, check out the <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/consume/nuget-faq#managing-packages-in-nuget.org">FAQ</a>.

    <h3>Found a bug in NuGet or the website NuGet.org?</h3>
    <p>
