    <h2>Developer Environment</h2>
    <p>This is a developer environment! 
        If you want to show a custom message here, either change the App_Data\Files\Content\Home.html file, 
        or if you are using the AzureStorageBlob package store type, upload a Home.md or Home.html to the "content" 
        container of your blob storage account.</p>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project 
      (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that 
      no clutter is left.</p>
</section>

<h3>Important Notice</h3>
<p>You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery. Read the documentation for more details on 
   <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package" 
     title="Creating and submitting a package">how to create and publish a package</a>.
   If you don't plan on submitting a package, there's no need to register.</p>
