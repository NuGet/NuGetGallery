### About
When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that no clutter is left.

### Important Notice
You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery. Read the documentation for more details on [how to create and publish a package](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package "Creating and submitting a package"). If you don't plan on submitting a package, there's no need to register.
