# History of Packages Removed from NuGet.org

Security of the package ecosystem is a top priority investment. 
Every package entering is scanned upfront and regularly rescanned to prevent malware. 
Scanning is not perfect. Community partnership is a very valuable part of the overall effort to keep developers safe. We take reports seriously, investigate carefully and prioritize speed of removal of positives to prevent adverse impact to the community. Thanks for your contribution!
