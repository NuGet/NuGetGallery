# NuGet Gallery Operations Toolkit

This is a set of operations tools designed for the official NuGet.org site. Its **sole** purpose is to make it easier for the NuGet Gallery team to maintain the site. This is **not** a general purpose operations toolkit and is not designed to work with every NuGetGallery installation. It works for us and we thought it might help those of you with private galleries, so we have open-sourced it. We'll do our best to help you use and configure it, but making this user-friendly is not our top priority :). We are very unlikely to take Pull Requests that don't directly enhance our workflows, but please do feel free to make and maintain forks for your own purposes and contribute back general-purpose changes that you think we might find helpful as well.
